# ADR 001: Branching Approach


## Context
There were already several conventions of branch naming and there is a need to settle on one approach

## Decision
We will create stable releases from `master` branch.
We will fix low effort bug in stable release on `master` branch.
We will fix high effort bug on  `issue/{ticket-number}` branch.
We will implement new features on `develop`.
We will develop high effort feature on `feature/{ticket-number}` branch.
We will implement versions for major EAP release on `{intellij-platform-major-version}-develop` branch.
We will create EAP releases from `*develop` branches.

We will create branch named `{intellij-platform-major-version}-release` when there is a need for maintenance of old version.

## Status: ACCEPTED

## Consequences
One branching that will make is easy to make sense of the repository
